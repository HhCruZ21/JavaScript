Learn about the console function in JS



Javascript for beginners

1. Variables in Javascript

    -> Why do we need Variables

    -> const, let, var 

        -> What are the rules for giving variable names in Javascript


2. Constants in Javascript

    -> We use the keyword const to declare such variables. Eg: const a = 2.14



Compare const, let and var in javascript.





3. Data types in JS can be of two types :- primitive and objects

    -> Primitive types are Number, string, boolean, null, undefined, Symbol

        ->  Range of number in java 1.79769e+308. Safe number would be 9007199254740991. Anything bigger can be used as of type BigInt.
            To get the max value allowed for numbers print the value of Number.MAX_VALUE. Whenever we go beyond this value we get result as infinity.
            If we say n at the end of a big number like 90071992547409911n then we can get the value as BigInt to prevent loss of data 
            which is present in the scientific notation.

        -> To improve readability of large numbers we can represent 10000000 as 100_00_000

        -> How to define numbers in different base systems, floating point numbers.



    -> String functions in javascript

        ->  String concatenation using +

        ->  To print something like Haizon "Helet" double quoutes inside the string, print it as "Haizon \"Helet\""

        -> String literals in javascript







4.  Type Conversion & Coercion


    ->  Explicit type Conversion

    ->  Implicit type Conversion

    ->  Coercion sets in an example operation like when we add a number and a string.
        Makes both of a compatible type and performs the operation


    ->  Difference between Number object and parseInt()






5. Operations in JS

    ->  Arithmetic, Relational. Logical, Assignment, Unary Operations

    ->  Terenary operation







6. Math functions in JS


7. Conditional Statements in JS

    -> if, if else, if elseif else, switch


8. Jump Statements in JS

    ->  break and continue are the jump statements in JS


9. Loops in JS

    ->  for, while, do-while, for-in Loops


10. Template Literals in JS

    -> Using the `` instead of double quotes and then use the ${} symbol to define literals in JS.



11. Objects in JS

    ->  var a = {} is how we define an object.

    ->  var a = {
                    name: "Haizon",
                    age: 23
                }

    ->  To get a value we do a.name

    ->  Say we have the name of the property in another variable 

        var p ='name'

        console.log(a[p])

    ->  To delete a property say name : delete a.name






12. Functions in JS

    ->  function function_name() {

                                }

    ->  Function return and passing

    ->  Function expressions in JS

        ->  let add = function(num1, num2) {

            return num1 + num2
        }

        let result = add(5,6)


    ->  Arrow functions in JS

        ->  let add = ()=> {

            function_body

        }




13. What is the difference between methods and functions in JS

14. this keyword

    ->
